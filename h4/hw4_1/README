The register file was augmented by:
1. Instantiating a register file in rf_bypass
2. Instatiating a rf_bypass in rf_hier
3. In rf_bypass:
	We XORed the write selection and the read selections
	The outputs of the XORs for each read select was NORed
	The outputs of the NORs were ANDed with the write signal
	The outputs of the ANDs were used as the select for 2 MUXes
	The MUXes take the output of the register file as their first input and the data input as their second input.  The output of the MUXes are the overall outputs.
